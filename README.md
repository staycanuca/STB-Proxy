# Setup

Install the latest Docker image with...

```
docker create \
--name=STB-Proxy \
--restart=always \
-p 8084:8001 \
-e HOST=10.0.1.200:8084 \
-v </host/path>:/config \
chris230291/stb-proxy:latest
```

- Map whichever port you like to the default `8001`
- `HOST` should be the docker hosts ip + the port you chose
- Mounting `/config` is required for settings to persist through restarts
- To configure go to the `HOST` in a browser eg 10.0.1.200:8084
